# Campus Connect 

## Inspiration
In school, our friend James Foo loved anime but was shy about his interest. He felt that if he expressed his interest to others, he wouldnâ€™t be thought of as seriously. So to help people like James find other people to talk about shared interests, we made Campus Connect!

## What it does
Project Campus Connect Mission helps people who are shy safely disclose their hobbies to people who share the same interest.

## How we built it
We built Campus Connect with the Materialize framework which is based off of Google's Material Design for the frontend. We used MySQL to store all of the current users, we then used ASP.NET Core to retrieve data from the database and convert it to json which was displayed on the website through POST/GET requests.

## Challenges we ran into
Some challenges we ran into included learning the ASP.NET framework in 2 hours, and editing information from the database.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our website has a really clean UI and a really enjoyable UX that is cross-compatible thanks to the materialize framework that we used. Also, our software works.

## What we learned
We learned how to use the ASP.NET framework and how to send POST/GET requests.

## What's next for Project CCM
Project Campus Connect Mission will continue to be updated through our github - continue to view our status at: https://github.com/varun-ramani/campusconnect
